# Advent of Code 2022
This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles, done in Rust. I've decided to
use this year's AoC as an opportunity to learn Rust programming language and get some
practice with it.

Repository itself consists of my inputs and solution source files for every puzzle in the
respective directories.

Each file contains a solution for both parts of a puzzle. To run any of them, use `cargo`.
For example, to run `day01` solution, use this command while being in the root directory
of the source tree:
```
cargo run --bin day01
```
